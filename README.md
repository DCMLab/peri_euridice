# Lyrics
This score was imported with archaic spellings in lyrics and titles (f instead of s, v instead of u, etc.) In the case of titles, these have been brought up to date with modern practice; lyrics in sections 1 and the first half of 2 have been brought up to date, but the remaining lyrics have not, and in the future they should be.
