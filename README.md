# Jacopo Peri – Euridice (1600)

This is, decisively, the oldest surviving opera; the first opera, the lost Dafne, was written by the same composer. The Greek myth of Orpheus and Eurydice was a powerful inspiration for the earliest opera composers, having also been adapted in the few years after by Giulio Caccini (Euridice, 1602) and Claudio Monteverdi (Orfeo, 1607, the most widely performed of these). Peri, Caccini, and (likely) librettist Ottavio Rinuccini were all members of the Florentine Camerata, a group which sought to return Western music to its Ancient Greek roots by supplanting the lush choral counterpoint of the day with bare solo singing over simple accompaniment, often using speech-like prosody. It is interesting to observe, compared to later opera, how seldom vocal virtuosity is highlighted: we do not see the contrast of elaborate aria and dry recitative that would be established as a convention of the form soon after. This is one of the oldest works in the DCML corpora (Sweelinck's Fantasia cromatica may or may not be older), and its analysis reflects, in nearly the simplest of possible uses, the frameworks that continued to emerge in tonal harmony for centuries after.
