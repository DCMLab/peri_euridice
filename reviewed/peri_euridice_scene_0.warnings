	No metronome mark found in the very first measure nor anywhere else in the score.
	* Please add one at the very beginning and hide it if it's not from the original print edition.
	* Make sure to choose the rhythmic unit that corresponds to beats in this piece and to set another mark wherever that unit changes.
	* The tempo marks can be rough estimates, maybe cross-checked with a recording.
