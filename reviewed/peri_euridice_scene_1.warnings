Warnings encountered during the last execution of ms3 review
============================================================

DCML_NON_CHORD_TONES_ABOVE_THRESHOLD_WARNING (19, 64, '1/2', 'VIIM7') ms3.Parse.peri_euridice.peri_euridice_scene_1
	The label 'VIIM7' in m. 62, onset 1/2 (MC 64, onset 1/2) seems not to correspond well to the score (which does not necessarily mean it is wrong).
	In the context of G.i, it expresses the scale degrees
	('7', '2', '4', '#6') [('F', 'A', 'C', 'E')].
	The corresponding score segment has 0 within-label and 2 out-of-label note onsets,
	a ratio of 1.0 > 0.6 (the current, arbitrary, threshold).
	If it turns out the label is correct, please add the header of this warning to the IGNORED_WARNINGS, ideally followed
	by a free-text comment in subsequent lines starting with a space or tab.
DCML_NON_CHORD_TONES_ABOVE_THRESHOLD_WARNING (19, 72, '3/2', 'V') ms3.Parse.peri_euridice.peri_euridice_scene_1
	The label 'V' in m. 70, onset 3/2 (MC 72, onset 3/2) seems not to correspond well to the score (which does not necessarily mean it is wrong).
	In the context of G.i, it expresses the scale degrees
	('5', '#7', '2') [('D', 'F#', 'A')].
	The corresponding score segment has 0 within-label and 2 out-of-label note onsets,
	a ratio of 1.0 > 0.6 (the current, arbitrary, threshold).
	If it turns out the label is correct, please add the header of this warning to the IGNORED_WARNINGS, ideally followed
